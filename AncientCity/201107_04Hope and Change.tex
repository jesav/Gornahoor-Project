\paragraph{Hope}
\begin{quotex}
Even the smallest initiative of a single man or group of men when it is properly organized, can result in a surprising variety of effects and long-term results. As soon as one realizes this fact, one becomes completely immune against despair. \flright{\textsc{Charles Maurras}}

\end{quotex}
\paragraph{Change}
\begin{quotex}
History sometimes produces surprising reversals or changes of direction. The secret of action consists in recognizing them and knowing how to make use of them, for although obviously we are not going to be able to reverse the whole direction of events by our personal and random tinkering with its works, sometimes quite a small push or twist of ours can set it rolling in a different direction and at a different speed. \flright{\textsc{Jean Ousset}, \emph{Action}}

\end{quotex}
