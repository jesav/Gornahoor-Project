\section{Passing Through the Realms of the Jinn}

The jinns are beings that inhabit the world between the angels and men. They are ancient and were created even before the Earth was fully formed. They occupy the sublunary space, which is above the Earth but below the celestial realms inhabited by angels. That is why they are also known as the spirits of the air.

Jinns are made from fire while men are made from earth (clay), water, and fire. Hence the jinns have a subtle body like humans, but lack a gross, or physical body. Also, like men, they don't have a fully actualized intellectual soul like the angels, so they are subject to dualist thinking. That means that they are both good and evil, they have their own institutions and ways of life.

Normally, the worlds of the jinns and humankind do not interfere with each other, but that is not always the case. Some believe that the jinns invade our world just to trick us or frighten us. Actually, it is the other way around. We have invaded their world.

As subtle bodies, they can experience our thoughts, memories, fantasies, and desires directly, without relying on the intermediary of words. Hence, our subtle bodies merge into their environment. Our foibles pollute their world. We are not the innocent victims of their tricks since they are just responding to our provocations.

They frighten you with horrific appearances because they sense your hidden fears.

They tempt you because they see your secret fantasies.

They lead you astray because they know your unfulfilled desires.

Although they do not have real earthen bodies, they can nevertheless appear as physical bodies in various guises, such as animals, alluring women, or even terrifying images. In that regard they are like rainbows, which appear to be ``there" yet are not really there.

\paragraph{Facing the Truth}
The worse jinns are not those who frighten, deceive, trick, or tempt you. Rather, the worse Jinns are the ones who tell you the truth. We are each born with two angels assigned to us: one to guide us and the other to challenge us. Together they record our thoughts, words, deeds, and actions – both good and bad.

As we pointed out, to travel from the Earth to the Heavens, it is necessary to pass through the Realms of the jinns. Since there is no such thing as free passage, tolls must be paid along the way. The price is not in terms of money, but rather in terms of self-knowledge and purification of the soul.

At each tollhouse, the traveler is challenged. The two recording angels make the case for you, both pro and con. Since the jinn can read your soul, he will make the judgment. You will be allowed to pass on through or not.

Initiates understand this and undertake this journey while still alive and conscious. Since they begin the process of purification in this life, they are prepared for what they hear about themselves on the way. Everyone else puts if off until death when they no longer have a physical body help maintain balance. They are shocked about what they learn, especially those who pride themselves on being so spiritual and advanced in life.

\paragraph{The Final Reveal}
I can only speak from one side of this equation.

The jinn have often tempted you while disguised as women. That is because they can read your soul and know how your Anima image will respond. So if you think the women you meet are horrible, deceitful, etc. – as is not uncommon today in some circles—perhaps you need to look into your own heart.

Once past the Realm of the Jinns, you will need a new guide to lead you through the Spheres of the Planets. She is your Twin Soul, with whom your life is entangled and has always been. Some of you may know already who she is, but most probably not. So the truth telling Jinn will reveal your one true love to you. That can be the most frightening of all. That is the one opportunity that must be seized.
