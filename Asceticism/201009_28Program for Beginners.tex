\section{Program for Beginners}

\begin{itemize}
\item Furnish your mind as completely as possible with the knowledge of how to inspect and control it. 
\item Train your body to obey your mind, and not to distract its attention. 
\item Control your mind to devote itself wholly to discover your True Will. 
\item Explore the course of that will till you reach its source, your Silent Self. 
\item Unite the conscious will with the True Will, and the conscious ego with the Silent Self. You must be utterly ruthless in discarding any atom of consciousness which is hostile or neutral 
\item Let this work freely from within, but heed not your environment, lest you make difference between one thing and another. Whatever it be, it is to be made one with you by love. 
\end{itemize}
